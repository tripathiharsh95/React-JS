Here’s what I accomplished:

Created a color button that changes the background color of the body with a simple click.

Utilized the useState() hook to manage state effectively.

Implemented an onClick event listener for interactive functionality.

Designed the project using Tailwind CSS for a sleek and modern look.

Every small project contributes to our growth as developers, and I’m excited to take this newfound confidence into more complex challenges ahead!
